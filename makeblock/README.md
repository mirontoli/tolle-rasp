# Get started
Download and put the Makeblock libraries to Arduino

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries.git
mv Makeblock-Libraries makeblock
cp -r makeblock /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/libraries/
```

Start Arduino IDE and choose the controller `Arduino/Genuino Mega and Mega 2560` and the appropriate port (`/dev/cu.wchusbserial1420` in my case).
