# My first Discord Bot

It just responds to messages and lists members. It is just my first test.

## Installation and requirements

Python 3.9 and higher is requireed, get the code, create a virtual environment and install the pip packages

```bash
python -m venv tdb001-venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In Visual Studio Code the virtual environment will be loaded automatically, so just press F5.

If in terminal, activate the virtual environment

```powershell
.\tdb001-venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

```bash
source tdb001-venv\bin\activate
```
